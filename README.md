This is my very first coding project so I decided to start with something simple. 
I fly aircrafts for a living so I decided to build a simple but useful tool I would use everyday at work.
This is a simple calculator to help with flight planning and computing the performance of an aircraft on take off and landing by figuring out the crosswind component of a runway based on the current reported weather conditions.
